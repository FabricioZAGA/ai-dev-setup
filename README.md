# ai-dev-setup v2.0

Automated developer environment setup for engineers who use Claude Code + Windsurf/Cursor. One script to configure git conventions, install AI slash commands, and enforce team standards across all your projects.

## Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/FabricioZAGA/ai-dev-setup.git
cd ai-dev-setup
chmod +x install.sh
./install.sh
```

---

## Commands

After setup, these slash commands are available in Claude Code in any project:

### Code Review

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/review-comment <PR>` | Reviews a PR diff and posts inline GitHub comments. Checks existing discussions first so it never duplicates. Writes like a teammate, not a bot. |
| `/review-fix <PR>` | Reads open review comments on your own PR, fixes the valid ones, pushes back with reasoning on incorrect ones, and commits. |
| `/pr-respond <PR>` | Drafts and posts replies to all open comments on a PR — questions, concerns, or requests for context. |

### Implementation

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/jira-to-windsurf <ticket>` | Analyzes a Jira ticket + codebase and generates a ready-to-run prompt for Windsurf Cascade. Saves to `.cascade-task.md` and copies to clipboard. |
| `/branch-from-jira <ticket>` | Creates a properly named branch and writes a `PLAN.md` with impact zones and implementation steps. |
| `/split-pr [ticket]` | Splits staged changes into a feature PR (impl only) and a tests PR (tests only), both properly linked. |
| `/test-gen <file or function>` | Generates tests following the project's exact patterns, fixtures, and mock style. |

### Planning & Delivery

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/cr <ticket>` | Generates a complete Change Request in Jira (all sections + Risk Assessment) from a ticket ID. |
| `/risk-assessment <ticket or PR>` | Generates a standalone Risk Assessment table for a Change Request. |
| `/standup [days]` | Generates a standup summary from git, PRs, and Jira activity. Defaults to 1 day; use 3 for Monday. |

### Environments

| Command | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| `/opdev create <name>` | Creates a new opdev environment on your current branch. Auto-rebases if behind master. |
| `/opdev sync <name>` | Syncs local server code to an opdev. |
| `/opdev logs <name>` | Prints the docker logs commands for the rq worker or web container. |
| `/opdev shell <name>` | Prints the SSM + docker exec commands to get a python shell inside the opdev. |
| `/opdev restart <name>` | Reboots the opdev EC2 instance and re-syncs code. |
| `/opdev delete <name>` | Deletes the opdev stack (asks for confirmation first). |

## Git Hooks

Three hooks are installed globally (apply to all repos) or per-project.

### `commit-msg` — Conventional Commits
Validates every commit against `type(scope): subject` format.

```bash
git commit -m "feat(auth): add OAuth2 login"   # ✓
git commit -m "updated stuff"                   # ✗ blocked
```

Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `test`, `refactor`, `chore`, `docs`, `ci`, `perf`, `build`, `revert`

### `pre-push` — Branch naming
Validates branch names against your configured pattern before push.

Default pattern: `{username}/{ticket}/{description}`

```bash
fzacarias/FIRE-3772/mvip-agent-emit-change   # ✓
my-feature                                   # ✗ blocked
```

### `prepare-commit-msg` — Strip AI co-author attribution
Automatically removes `Co-Authored-By:` lines from any AI assistant (Claude, Copilot, etc.) so commits only show the real author.
