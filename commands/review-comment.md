You are doing a thorough code review of a GitHub PR and posting inline comments directly on GitHub. Write like a teammate, not a tool.

PR reference: $ARGUMENTS

## Steps

### 1. Identify the PR
- If `$ARGUMENTS` is a number, use it directly.
- If it's a branch name or partial title, run `gh pr list --search "$ARGUMENTS"` to find the PR number.
- Run `gh pr view <number> --json number,title,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,author` to get PR metadata.
  - Save `headRefOid` and `number`.

### 2. Load existing discussions (deduplicate before posting)
Fetch all existing inline comments:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/comments \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, path, line: .original_line, body, user: .user.login, resolved: (if .position == null then true else false end)}]'
```
Also fetch top-level review comments:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --jq '[.[] | {id, state, body, user: .user.login}]'
```

For every issue you find in step 4, check if it's already covered by an existing comment:
- **Already covered and unresolved:** skip your comment entirely, or reply to the existing thread with additional context if you have something genuinely useful to add.
- **Covered by a resolved comment that came back:** note the regression.
- **Not covered:** post a new comment.

### 3. Get the diff
Run `gh pr diff <number>` and read it fully. Pay attention to:
- File paths and line numbers (new file lines use `+`, counts start at 1 in the new file)
- Context lines that tell you what the surrounding code does

### 4. Review the diff
Check every changed file for real issues. Not all will apply.

**Correctness**
- Logic bugs, off-by-one errors, missing edge cases
- Incorrect return values or missing early returns
- Null/None dereferences without guards

**Type safety**
- Missing `Optional` when a parameter defaults to `None`
- Incorrect use of enum `.name` vs `.value`
- Wrong data types passed or returned

**Security**
- Unvalidated input reaching SQL, shell, or HTML
- Secrets or credentials in code

**Templates / markup**
- Missing conditional guards around optional fields
- Inconsistent quote styles or template variable syntax

**Tests**
- Missing mock for a new function that makes external calls (DB, Kafka, HTTP, Celery jobs)
- Happy path or key edge case not covered
- Test that won't actually catch regressions because mocks are too deep

**Style & conventions**
- Dead code or unused imports introduced
- Naming inconsistencies with the rest of the file

### 5. Post inline comments

For each real issue (skip nitpicks that don't affect correctness or maintainability):

```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/comments \
  --method POST \
  --field commit_id="<headRefOid>" \
  --field path="<file_path>" \
  --field line=<line_number_in_new_file> \
  --field side="RIGHT" \
  --field body="<comment>"
```

**Tone rules — write like a teammate on Slack, not a code review bot:**
- Keep it short: 1-3 sentences for most issues. If it needs more, the issue is complex.
- No em dashes (avoid `--` and `—`). Use commas, semicolons, or just start a new sentence.
- No section headers or bullet lists inside a single comment. Prose only.
- Use questions for things that might be intentional ("is this intentional? if the value is None here it'll blow up on line 42"). Use assertions for clear bugs.
- Vary how you open comments. Don't start every one the same way.
- Contractions are fine ("this'll", "it's", "shouldn't").
- Reference the specific context: "since this runs on every agent save..." or "the existing `post_user_op_id_config` does this differently..."
- If you're suggesting a fix, include a `suggestion` block. Keep suggestions to 1-3 lines.
- Don't explain what the code does. Explain what's wrong or what the reviewer should consider.

**Examples of bad tone (avoid):**
- "This is an issue because the parameter can be None and this will cause a NullPointerException."
- "Consider using Optional[str] here -- this would be more type-safe."

**Examples of good tone:**
- "if `uwp_rcc_user_uuid` is None here this blows up, worth guarding"
- "shouldn't this be `Optional[str]`? the caller at line 428 passes None in the no-rcc-group case"

### 6. Decide on approve vs. comment
After reviewing:
- If you found real issues: post comments, do NOT approve yet.
- If the code is clean (or prior comments are fully resolved): approve with a genuine message.

To approve:
```bash
gh api repos/{owner}/{repo}/pulls/<number>/reviews \
  --method POST \
  --field commit_id="<headRefOid>" \
  --field event="APPROVE" \
  --field body="<short genuine message — LGTM, nice work, etc.>"
```

The approve message should be short and real, not a summary of everything you checked. "LGTM, nice clean implementation" is better than a paragraph recap.

### 7. Report
After posting all comments (or approving), print a summary table:

| File | Line | Issue |
|------|------|-------|
| ... | ... | ... |

Print the PR URL.
